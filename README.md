  <strong>The one stop solution to managing all your social media influence on a single platform.</strong>
</p>

## About 
Ever felt the need for sharing more than just links on your Social Media bio? Ever felt the need for a single platform to showcase all your work? Well, LinkList was made just for that! It gathers all of your social links and proof of work into a single page that is easy to navigate. LinkedList is an open-source alternative to paid, limited tools like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/).

## Why use LinkedList?

Social Media like Instagram, Twitter, e.t.c neither provides support for multiple clickable links nor a place to show all your work to your audience on post captions or on your bio. To help you overcome this limitation, tools like Linktree were made, providing users the ability to use their one stop URL field to direct viewers to multiple destinations.

While these tools are simple by design, they tend to be a more expensive and less customizable solution than they should. Using Linktree as an example is very limiting like the free version doesn't even provide you with proper theme and UI customization options.

## Features

* [ ] Display all your social media links in a single place
* [ ] Show all your work to your audience
* [ ] Custom Logo
* [ ] Custom Favicon
