# LinkedList
The one stop solution to managing all your social media links on a single platform

## About 
Ever felt the need for adding more links to your Social Media bio? LinkList was made just for that! It gathers all of your social links into one page that is easy to navigate. LinkedList is an open-source alternative to paid, limited tools like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/).

## Why use LinkedList?

Social Media like Instagram, Twitter, e.t.c does not provide support for multiple clickable links on post captions or on your bio. To help you overcome this limitation, tools like Linktree were made, providing users the ability to use their one stop URL field to direct viewers to multiple destinations.

While these tools are simple by design, we consider them to be more expensive and less customizable than they should. Using Linktree as an example is very limiting ike the free version doesn't even provide a proper theme and UI customization options.
